        <p>Your company assigns each customer a membership ID, and you are implementing a check digit for those IDs.</p>

        <p>The check digit should be calculated by adding up all digits in each membership ID. If the result of the sum is a number with more than a single digit, another iteration is required, and the digits of the result also should be added together. This process should repeat until a single-digit number is calculated.</p>
        
        <p>For example, for the membership ID "55555" the sum of all digits is 25. Because this is not a single-digit number, 2 and 5 would be added, and the result, 7, would be the check digit.</p>
